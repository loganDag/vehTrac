# WELCOME TO THE *VEHTRAC* REPO

### Info:
This repository is the home of *VehTrac* or *Vehicle Track.* This was a project I started working on and made some progress on a long time ago, it is
one of my advanced projects to date. I was orginally going to keep it private, then I had the God-given thought to open-source it and let others experiment and also contribute. I really do not plan on making money or trying to sell it, not yet at least. So, right now, it is open source and I open to any contributions and things of the sort. Please, if you notice security issues, make them known via the *SECUIRTY* tab and an *ISSUE.* Thank you and May God bless and keep you!
