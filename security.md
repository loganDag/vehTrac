# Security Policy

For the sake of simplicity and to stay consist with the current versioning out there, we will use the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for the versioning of this website.

Currently, there is one version of the website right now, released under a *Pre-Release* tag since it isn't entirely finished.


### Reporting issues

To report a security issue, that is not explicitly stated in the release notes, please submit an issue in the ***ISSUES*** tab with the version you are using, what is wrong, and with the *Security Issue* and ***Security Review*** Labels selected. Please, also submit a security issue in the security tab as well.

A team member will review the issue and prioritize the issue appropriately.

If you believe you can fix it or have a fix, please let us know is the *Issue* description and we will discuss about it there.

### Current Supported Versions:
